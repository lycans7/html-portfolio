<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>Tom and Jerry</h3>

<p>
  It's about a hapless cat's never-ending pursuit of a clever mouse. Tom is the
  scheming cat, and Jerry is the spunky mouse.
</p>
<p>
  Jerry was a very small creature in front of Tom but Jerry was also an
  undefeated champ and always played out Tom with his intelligence,
  determination and potential. We should never ever underestimate our opponent
  or anyone looking at their size or assuming they are small or powerless.

<h3>Inception</h3>

<p>
  Real cool Sci-fi Movie. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare
  ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their
  subconscious. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate
  espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at
  redemption when he is offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in
  someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous
  enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.
